Everything is packed. Everything is labeled. Looking at these forty boxes, I realize that he never purchased much of objects during the year 2015. More space, an empty apartment to fill two. Furniture for every room.

Few recovery because I wanted to highlight the volume without distorting the parts, as we say in architecture, or rather in the interior design.

Yet it was to forget who I am and what I do especially: for 10 years now, I move on average every year. I'm not seasonal, far from it. But I like to change is all. I adapt. Sometimes 2, 3 or even 4 or 5 collocations, I often changed the atmosphere. Often in Grenoble, a city that I particularly like, sometimes back to the countryside.
When I see all these boxes, I cannot help but think of Alex, a seasonal cook who lugs around his life in two huge suitcases. He must have a secret, I'm sure! I put my guitar or my kite in your suitcase? What do without my microwave and my TV? I smiled stupidly, realizing my thoughts of Western guys.

But it is time to let go. In recent months, I have experienced some alternative lifestyles through my readings between zero waste Bea Johnson and Life "vacuum" of Marie Kondo, one can say that I got rid of a lot of things, learned to give, I who have always had trouble with that.

Now I want to give everything, at least that I do not use. IRZ here on, I have always given everything: my impressions, my meager knowledge, and even home coloring! But I digress.

All that to say that I would love to have my life in my backpack. Whenever I do my backpack for a day to my home, I realize that I can do without most of the things I have. A pair of shoes, some strings, a good sweater, a computer and go! Is not that ultimately the solution? Stop living somewhere? Become a citizen of the world and a simple Grenoble?

"The things you own end up owning you."
Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club

When you have an object, it ends up owning us. If I own a house or apartment, she will eventually have me?

Tomorrow I move. I do not know what tomorrow will bring, and that's what I like. Get out of my comfort zone, it was that I needed.
