message: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI'd like to buy Sony Xperia V on Digitiland website.\r\nDo you know if the bill mentions the phone is from UK? Cause if the bill mentions it's from Hong Kong (even though shipped from UK), I'm scared Sony France will not allow me to use the warranty in case of a problem.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Sony France told me on phone that if the device was purchased in the UK, it's fine as the warranty is European, and they can handle the repair (unless it's a major problem like a dead motherboard, in that case I need to send the phone back to Sony UK directly). However, if the phone was bought in Hong Kong, the warranty doesn't work at all.\r\n\r\nHTC is way better for this, as their warranty can be used worldwide.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, I hope someone was in the same situation as me and found the answer!"
