  Hello everyone I want to buy xperia v digitiland you know if the bill is
  written it just for England if he writes is shipped through England and on the
  invoice it comes from hong kong I fear that France does not accept sony
  warranty coverage because they told me that if its sony France has a store in
  England when his pass unless it is such a big problem off the motherboard must
  be redirected to the uk sony sony but in no case not cover the warranty if it
  comes from hong kong (asia) htc is better because their warranty is valid
  worldwide without exception provided that is a thank you person in the same
  situation as me who knows the answer.
